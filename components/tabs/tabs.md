## Component documentation

_Add component specific documentation here._

### HTML

This component provides needed JavaScript functionalities to bring the Bulma tabs to life. To make the tabs accessible links are anchors for the content. When the user clicks a tab link focus is moved to the first element of the tab content. In order for this to work, the `href` attribute of the link must be the id of the first focusable element in the tab container.
